# Goldbach
Plots unique number of ways to make an even number >= 4 out of two primes

Here is the result of running 
```matlab
goldbach(1000)
```

![goldbach(1000) graph](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jackmoody11/goldbach/master/goldbach1000.PNG)

As a quick way to test this function, you can insert this function into Octave and run `goldbach(500)` at [https://octave-online.net/](https://octave-online.net/).


## Future Ideas
In the future, it would be interesting to have a moving average plot that overlays on top of this graph to see how many different pairs of primes can be used to make any even number.
